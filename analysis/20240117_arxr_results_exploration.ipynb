    "Google was showing 45.3% negative sentiment and Vuzix was showing 63% positive. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Google Glasses Sentiment Discrepancies\n",
    "@Tiffany when I look in the dashboard I see that google glasses has 41.4% negative from the llm_label. @Michelle doing a comparison between the llm_label and our out of box sentiment labels it is pretty comparable, with android_sentiment (our own NLP model) predicting relatively high negative numbers(~38%). Looking at the llm_labels when predicting sentiment, and when the llm_label disagrees with the out of box model, I would argue that the LLM label seems to be more accurate in terms of judging the text based on the entity specific sentiment, not just sentiment as a whole, which was the goal of this project. For reasons why these numbers seem high compared to previous sentiment numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Our out of box sentiment models are not entity specific. To demonstrate how our out of box sentiment models work let's take two text examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I love apple. Apple is great and amazing and wonderful. Android is the worst brand to ever grace the face of the earth.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Out-of-box android sentiment model (non-entity specific): Labels this as positive. This is because there are more positive words than negative words in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "LLM model when asked to label the sentiment of the text based on the entitiy Android: Labels this as negative. \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Can Microsoft succeed where Google failed? The company has recently filed a patent for augmented reality (AR)\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Out-of-box android sentiment model (non-entity specific): Labels this as neutral, this is because there are more neutral words/tones in the text than positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "LLM model when asked to label the sentiment of the text based on the entitiy Google Glasses: Labels this as negative, because contextually it is more negative towards Google. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore the extremes of positive and negatives may appear higher than normal compared to non-entity specific models, and even neutrals may appear to be lower than normal as it is now labeling the text based on the entity in question. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The glasses query happened to capture a lot more negative language.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We are adding in news sources too, of which many of them did seem relatively negative to google glasses. Typically we don't include news as a source in the analyst dash\n",
    "\n",
    "4. These numbers are correct and on social most people talk negatively about google glasses \n",
    "\n",
    "Moving forward, if the data does not seem truly negative (keeping in mind that that there is about 10-25% of the time both our own out of box models and the llm get the sentiment wrong), then we would need to adjust in the prompt to specific cases for why the text should not be labeled negative. In the image I shared comparing the android_sentiment model and the llm_label, this is a random sample of 15 out of 4073 negative observations. Of this sample, I would agree with the llm_label at least 80% of the time, disagreeing with the non-entity specific label 20% of the time or less.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vuzix Glasses Sentiment Discrepancies\n",
    "Looking at the dashboard I get 58.9% for the llm_label and 18% positive for android sentiment. The percentages are in less agreement with each other. Exploring the data to compare android sentiment and llm sentiment, it is a bit difficult to say which is right due the type of posts being pulled in. For vuzix, we only pulled in 2268 mentions. The majority of those mentions come from twitter (~70%) and of those twitter mentions most appear to be retweeets and promotional. Note that most promotional tweets e.g. \"RT Vuzix and Join Forces to Redefine Smart with Printing. Read more about our latest news on integrating 3D printing into the process for Vuzix’s smart glasses via here: $vuzi\t\" tend to be more positive leaning, especially from an entity perspective. Moving forward, one possible options is to remove retweets (but then the sample size will get smaller), or consider all promotional tweets as neutral, which then the majority will be neutral because the majority of the posts are promotional. I showed the comparison of the android sentiment and llm label below, again note that the LLM model is labeling based on the sentiment specific to Vuzix glasses. The android sentiment model labels these all as neutrals because the majority appear to be promotional, where as the llm is labeling these as positive in respect to Vuzix. @Natalie do you have a particular way you would like to move forward with this example? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If none of this made sense, please feel free to ask away with questions, and if anything else comes up in the data ensure you flag me so I can investigate. Thanks! \n"
